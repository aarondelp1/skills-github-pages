## About Me 🚀

I'm the co-host/co-founder of The Cloudcast podcast, the world's largest independent podcast on cloud computing and emerging tech with over 15 million downloads to date. I'm an AI and emerging tech junkie, and I have a passion for learning and sharing. My day job is creating technical content for AI.

This is a hobby project site, I dabble in retro gaming devices (I own 3x Anbernics at the moment). I'm working my way through old games using retroachievements.org (link to profile below), and I'm working on restoring a 5th-gen iPod to 2025 standards for lossless music that I'll be posting about later this fall, including some code I want to write to fill a few gaps to make that happen

- 🌱 Currently learning: GitHub, iPod Classic restoration
- 🔭 Working on: Trail running & getting back in shape to compete in triathlon again
- 🌍 Languages: I plan to resuurect my computer science degree skills starting with Python
- 📫 How to reach me: I'm off most of the social media these days so LinkedIn is the best way to reach me
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love music and retro games. Check out what I'm playing here: https://retroachievements.org/user/Ruttin
